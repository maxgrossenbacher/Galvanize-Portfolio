# Galvanize-Portfolio
Collection of case studies I have completed while working through the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program. During these case studies, we were required to utlize skills in data munging, cleaning, visualization, regression analysis and machine learning to come up with efficient, presentable solutions to industry relevant problems.

##[Regression-case-study](https://github.com/maxgrossenbacher/Galvanize-Portfolio/tree/master/regression_case_study)  
we were required to predict the price of an item based on 50+ features.

##[Churn-case-study](https://github.com/maxgrossenbacher/Galvanize-Portfolio/tree/master/churn_case_study)  
we were required to predict the likelihood of churn based on user profiles in order to provide solutions to improve user retention.

##[Recommender-case-study](https://github.com/maxgrossenbacher/Galvanize-Portfolio/tree/master/recommender_case_study)  
we were required to build a recommender system to beat the baseline recommender. This recommmeder was built using pySPARK.

##[Fraud-case-study](https://github.com/maxgrossenbacher/Galvanize-Portfolio/tree/master/fraud_detection_case_study)  
we were required to build a full-stack system from scratch to predict possible fraudulent sales. This required data munging, feature engineering, building predictive models and a website using Flask.
